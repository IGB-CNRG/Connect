# CONNECT

IGB CONNECT (Comprehensive ONline Network of Employees, Centers and Themes) is the central repository for all of IGB's personnel information. It will handle on- and off-boarding for all personnel, and tie into several other systems when applicable. It will be easy-to-use and display useful, targeted information to encourage everyone to use it as intended. It is our goal in this project to simplify everyone's work, not to add to it.
